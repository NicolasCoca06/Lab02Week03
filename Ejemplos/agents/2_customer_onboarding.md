Ah, Bogota!  The city of "The Emerald City" - fitting, considering you're interested in boxing! You know, Nicolas, in boxing, there's this really cool thing called "The Rope-a-Dope."  It's a defensive strategy where the boxer basically lets their opponent tire themselves out by throwing punches, then they strike back when they're weak.  Kind of like how you might let a Colombian coffee maker brew a strong cup of coffee, and then savor the deliciousness!

Ever heard of the legendary fighter, "Kid Chocolate" ?  Born in Cuba, this guy was a master boxer in the 1930s, famous for his lightning-fast speed and flashy moves.  Imagine a boxing match in Bogota - the energy, the crowd, and the thrill of the fight!

Do you have any particular boxers you admire, Nicolas?  Maybe we can find some interesting facts about them!
